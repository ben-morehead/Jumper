Below are the steps to integrate CanvasJS Chart / StockChart in your react app.
1. Save canvasjs.react.js and canvasjs.min.js(canvasjs.stock.react.js and canvasjs.stock.min.js in case of StockChart) within source-folder of your React application ( src or src/assets or src/lib ).
2. Import the library into your app.


For Chart:
import CanvasJSReact from './canvasjs.react';
var CanvasJSChart = CanvasJSReact.CanvasJSChart;

For StockChart:
import CanvasJSReact from './canvasjs.stock.react';
var CanvasJSStockChart = CanvasJSReact.CanvasJSStockChart;

Once itâ€™s imported, you are ready to go. Now you can create Chart / StockChart, pass options & render them.
